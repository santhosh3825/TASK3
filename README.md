# 🧠 SQL Data Analysis Project – E-commerce Database

## 📄 Summary
This project is a hands-on SQL practice assignment where I explored how to analyze and understand data from an e-commerce database using MySQL (also compatible with PostgreSQL and SQLite). It includes writing queries for filtering data, sorting results, grouping values, joining tables, using subqueries, and calculating totals and averages. I also practiced creating views to simplify queries and added indexes to make searches faster. The results of each query are saved as screenshots, and all the queries are stored in a `.sql` file. This helped me improve my SQL skills and understand how data is used in real-world business analysis.

## 📌 Project Objective
Use SQL to perform meaningful analysis and gain insights from a sample e-commerce database. This includes both simple and advanced query techniques.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- MySQL 8.0.42 (can also use PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Command Line Client / MySQL Workbench
- Python (optional, for automation)
- Screenshot tool (e.g., Snipping Tool, Lightshot)

### ✅ a. Basic SQL Queries
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`

### 🔗 b. Joins
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`

### 📦 c. Subqueries
- Using nested queries for filtered results

### ➕ d. Aggregate Functions
